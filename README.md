# Storming Code
A vim theme based on blue colors and inspired in Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive

This theme has many features:
- Nice Kholin Blue for the background
- You will never find yourself without light, as it has stormlight blue colors
- Various shades of greyish-blue inspired on the Highstorm, so you will feel as if you were still on Roshar
- Some goldish tones to help you in your Calling
- Normal letters in white dye brought directly from Liafor, maximum quality
- All colors used are flammable, so it can be used to write prayers to the Almighty
